            <p>
                I created this calculator to show how much of a difference
                only a few minutes per day practicing a skill can pay off
                in the long term. Based on the idea of 10,000 hours to master a skill
                this calculator lets you pick how many hours you want to practice a skill. 
                 <p>
                     for example, let's say you wanted to 
                    practice the kazoo for 300 hours, and you only wanted to spend
                    20 minutes per day. That would take you about 900 days
                    to reach your goal. 
                 </p>
                <p>
                    Increasing that daily practice to 25 minutes per day reduces it 
                    to only 720 days! Cutting more than half a year off of your 300 hour 
                    goal!
